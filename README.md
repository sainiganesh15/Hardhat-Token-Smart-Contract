# Hardhat-Token Smart Contract

This project is a basic implementation of a Token smart contract, including the ability to transfer tokens between accounts and check balances.

## Prerequisites
To use this project, you will need the following tools installed:

- Node.js
- Hardhat
- Metamask (for testing on a local blockchain)

## Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/example/token-smart-contract.git
cd token-smart-contract
npm install
```

## Usage
### Testing
To run the tests, use the following command:

```npx hardhat test```

This will deploy the smart contract on a local blockchain, run the tests, and then tear down the blockchain. The test results will be displayed in the console.

### Deploying
To deploy the smart contract to a live blockchain network, you will need to set up a Hardhat network configuration file with your network settings. For example, here is a sample configuration file for the Goerli test network:

```bash
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle");

const ALCHEMY_API_KEY = "YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY";
const GOERLI_PRIVATE_KEY = "YOUR_GOERLI_PRIVATE_KEY";

module.exports = {
  solidity: "^0.8.0",

  networks: {
    goerli: {
      url: `https://eth-goerli.alchemyapi.io/v2/${ALCHEMY_API_KEY}`,
      accounts: [GOERLI_PRIVATE_KEY]
    }
  }
};
```
To deploy the smart contract to the network, use the following command:
```bash
npx hardhat run --network goerli scripts/deploy.js
```
This will deploy the smart contract to the Goerli test network using the `scripts/deploy.js` script.
